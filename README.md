# Reliablity Fusing Map (RFM)

â€‹This repository is implementation of "Image Tampering Detection and Localization via CNN-Based Reliablity Fusing Map (RFM)". The main contributions are summarized as follows  (1) obtaining higher accuracy; (2) reducing computational complexity of clustering; (3) improving localization fineness from 64 x 64 to 32 x 32.

# Prerequisites

* tensorflow == 1.7.0
* pandas == 0.23.4
* scipy == 1.1.0
* sklearn == 0.19.2
* matplotlib == 2.2.3
* Pillow == 5.2.0

# Usage

1. Download Drensden dataset into /code/dataset

2. For training process, running command:

   > python main.py --conf code.config --action train

   where `code.config.py` is config file including CNN architecture, dataset name, and so on.

3. For testing process, running command:

   > python main.py --conf code.config --action test

4. Also, you can make your personal tampering dataset:

   > python main.py --conf code.config --action splicing
